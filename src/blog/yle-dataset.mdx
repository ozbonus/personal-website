Cambridge English offers a range of very nice assessments for learners of English as a second language. I personally have been preparing students to take their Young Learners English (YLE) examinations for a quite a few years now. They publish lists of vocabulary that students should know at each level, but I've only ever found it in hardcopy or PDF formats, like this one:

That's nice, but hardly flexible. If I wanted to get, for example, a list of all nouns with irregular plurals used in Starters and Movers, then I'd have a lot of work ahead of me flipping through pages and trying to copy lists of words from a fiddly PDF document. To make tasks like this easier I collected all of the words and assigned them a bunch of true/false values according to their properties.

The spreadsheet linked below is the quickest way to view and interact with the dataset. You can make a copy of your own and use filters to find words with any combination of properties you wish. How about a list of all the words that are different between British and American English? A list of words related to animals and the natural world? Well, that'll be a lot easier now.

For those of you who'd like a `csv` file of the raw data. here you go:
