Teaching at an ESL cram school means that you'll occasionally get roped into efforts to recruit new students. School festivals in particular are a big deal because they offer an opportunity to engage with possibly hundreds of students and their families, but getting their attention is a challenge among the numerous other attractions. That's why I made Animal or Vegetable, a simple arcade style video game with flashy visuals, music, and gameplay that was so successful the first time I used it, my school ran out of promotional handouts two hours before the event was over.

This blog post will show you how Animal or Vegetable works and how you can modify it and use it at your own promotional events.

## Audience and time requirements

Animal or Vegetable can be played by one to four players simultaneously. It works best with elementary school aged children, but older players will have a good time, too. A game usually takes about one minute, including the time to say hello to the players, show them how to play, and congratulate them when they finish. One adult is required to operate the game and explain how to play.

## Video demonstration

Here is a brief demonstration of how the game is played. Overlays show what keyboard keys the operator presses to advance to different screens and titles explain what happens on each screen. This video comprises recordings from multiple play sessions and the gameplay portion is cut roughly in half to save time. Also, the players were quite young, so they only played on the easiest difficulty.

## How to play (player's POV)

<PostPicture src={closeup} alt={"A closeup of the player controls."} title="Controls"/>

These two buttons are all you need to play.

<PostPicture src={age} alt={"An animation of the player entering their age."} showAlt={false} title="Age" />

Use the buttons to enter your age. The numbers only range from 5 to 14+, but anyone can play. Older players get a more challenging game. Younger players get a simpler game and extra points.

<PostPicture src={pushBoth} alt={"An animation of the tutorial mode."} showAlt={false} title="Tutorial" />

If the little arrow is pointing at an animal, push the left button. If the little arrow is pointing at a plant, push the right button.

<PostPicture src={slow} alt={"An animation of the player being warned to slow down."} showAlt={false} title="Slow down!" />

Play quickly, but carefully. If you just hit the buttons crazily, the game will stop until you slow down.

<PostPicture src={mash} alt={"An animation of the button-mashing bonus game."} showAlt={false} title="Mash!" />

If you're doing a good job, sometimes you can play a quick bonus game. Push the two buttons as fast as you can!

## How to play (operator's POV)

Think of the game as having five modes that you cycle through: attract, age, tutorial, game, and score. You can move to the next mode in the sequence by pressing the `Enter` key on your keyboard. To move back to the previous mode press the `Backspace` key.

<PostPicture src={modeFlow} alt={"A diagram of mode transitions: attract, age, tutorial, game, and score."} title="Modes cycle" />

### Attract mode

This mode is designed to be noticeable from a great distance both visually and audibly. It's also where you can add players to the game. Use the 1, 2, 3, and 4 keys on your keyboard to add or remove the corresponding player. When all of the players are ready press `Enter` to go to the next mode.

### Age mode

Have the players enter their ages using the game controllers. The left button should lower the age by 1 and the right button should increase the age by 1.

Age affects difficulty and scoring. By default players 8 and below will play on easy mode, 9 to 10 will play on medium mode, and 11 and older will play on hard mode. These settings reflect the abilities of the students I interact with, but your needs may be different.
After all of the students have entered an age, press `Enter` to go to the next mode.

### Tutorial mode

This mode has five steps that explain how to play the game. You progress through the steps by pushing the right arrow key on your keyboard. Verbally explain to players as they progress through the five stages of the tutorial.

1. Press the left button when the little arrow points at an animal.

1. Push the right button when the little arrow points at a plant.

1. Practice animal.

1. Practice plant.

1. Teach the button mashing bonus game.

After everyone knows how to play, press `Enter` to go to the next mode. You don't have to go through all steps first, you can press Enter at any time.

### Game mode

There's nothing for you to do during this mode except cheer on the players and offer help where necessary.

As players do well and classify sets of cards without making mistakes the difficulty of the game can increase through three difficulty levels that affect the kind of cards that appear: easy, medium, and hard. On easy the cards are large images. On medium they are small images with text. On hard they are text only.

Depending on the age of players, the difficulty progression may be capped at a level lower than hard. By default players 8 and younger are capped at easy difficulty. Players who are 9 or 10 are capped at medium difficulty. Players 11 and older have no difficulty cap. These settings reflect the abilities of the students I usually interact with. You may decide to change these settings to fit your needs.

Each difficulty level has five sub-levels which corresponds to the number of cards shown to a player at one time, a “set”. A difficult of Medium-3, for example, means that a player has to categorize a set three medium difficulty cards. Making a mistake in a set lowers the difficulty level.

Here are cards from the three difficulty levels:

<PostPicture src={difficulty} alt={"Left: An easy difficulty card, which just a picture of a cat. Middle: A medium difficulty card, which has a small banana next to the word banana. Right: A hard difficulty card, which is just the word rice."} title="Difficulty levels" />

If a player is just pressing buttons wildly, cards will stop appearing and a warning will appear, telling the player to slow down. After not pushing any buttons for a short amount of time the game resumes as normal.

If a player correctly categorizes all of the cards in a certain number of consecutive sets, by default three, then they can play the button mashing bonus game for extra points.

The game will stop automatically when the timer at the top of the screen reaches 0. Press `Enter` to go to the next mode. You can also go to the next mode before the timer completes if you are in a hurry.

### Score mode

This mode dramatically reveals the scores of each player, presented as dollars. Your job on this screen is to happily congratulate the players and send them on their way.

By default one correct answer awards 100+(14-AGE)*10 points. So a 14 year-old gets 100 points, but an 8 year-old get 160 points. Completing a whole set of cards with no mistakes awards and extra 200 points. The button mashing bonus game awards 140 points per button press.

In the rare case that a player gets zero points, a random small amount of points are awarded so they still get to see their score animated with the others. In the slightly less rare case there are identical scores at the end of the game, small amounts of points are distributed at random until they're all different.

Press the `Enter` key to go back to the attract mode and play with another group of players.

1. Clone the GitHub repository to the macOS computer that will run the game. https://github.com/ozbonus/animal-vegetable

1. Open Godot and import project.godot.

1. Set your controller inputs.

    1. Open the project in the editor.

    1. From the application menu go to Project > Project Settings... > Input Map.

    1. Configure controller buttons for `p1_left`, `p1_right`, `p2_left`, `p2_right`, `p3_left`, `p3_right`, `p4_left`, and `p4_right`.

    1. You may also change the keys for the operator.

1. Tweak additional settings as described in [Customization](#customization).

1. Run the game. Press Command + B or press the play button (at the top right of the window) to run the game directly from the editor. Or you can export a `pkg` file from the application menu at Project > Export... .

## Customization

There are numerous options that you can tweak to make Animal or Vegetable fit your needs. In this section I'll list Godot scene files and what changes you can make within them. Usually any variables worth changing are accessible within the inspector panel, so you won't need to edit script files directly.

> You should really do a few Godot tutorials before making any changes. I strongly recommend “Your first 2D game” from the official Godot website.

## Contribute

Animal or vegetable is an open source project and contributions are welcome. Compared to most video games, this one is pretty simple and if you already know Python, learning GDScript will be a breeze. I recommend following through the official walkthrough, “Your first 2D game”, which will teach you enough about the engine and language to start making contributions.

> https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html

You should know that the game was originally made under a very tight deadline and that's reflected in the code base. Here's hoping I have time for a rewrite in the future.
You can also submit bugs and desired features on the GitHub issues page.

## Custom controllers

For my own use I created game controllers for four players inside of two simple cardboard boxes, with two controllers housed in each. The cost of materials was very low compared to off the shelf solutions, but required a significant amount of time. You may decide that buying some simple game controllers is a better fit for your needs.

A detailed guide on how I built my controllers is beyond the scope of this post, but I’ll include some information that you can start with.

### Materials

Other than the cardboard boxes the controllers use eight microswitches inside of eight buttons. They’re not any particular brand, just generic parts from my local electronics shop in Taipei.

Inside of each box is an Arduino Leonardo, which is far more power than what this project calls for, but they are still cheap and have the advantage of being recognized by computers as USB input devices with no additional hardware.

> https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/leonardo/

The wires have crimp connecters for the switches and Dupont connectors for the Arduinos, so no soldering is required.

<PostPicture src={hardware} alt="Top: An overview of the wiring from an Arduino to four switches. Left: A closeup of a switch with spade connectors on C and NC. Right: A closeup of the wires connected to an Arduino's GND, ~13, 12, ~11, and ~10 IO headers" title="Hardware" />

### Software

The very simple Arduino `.ino` file is hosted on GitHub. Because I used two Arduinos each one needs slightly different settings so they can be recognized as independent devices. This is accomplished by commenting-out either lines 14 and 15, or lines 18 and 19 before uploading to the Arduinos.
