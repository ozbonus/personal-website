## Who can play

This game is suitable for students who are able to write words independently while under some competitive pressure. The minimum number of players is four per round, but many more can play as well.

## Materials

You'll need a whiteboard and several whiteboard markers of at least two different colors. The wider the whiteboard and the more markers you have, the more students can play at once. You'll need a few whiteboard erasers, too.

## How to play

Pick at least four students and divide them into groups of two. If your whiteboard is large enough and you have enough markers, you can play with even more groups at once. Send them to the whiteboard and have each student pick up a marker. Each student in a group must have a different color marker than their partner.

Say a word. Each group of students has to cooperate to write the word. One student writes the first letter with their marker, then the other student writes the second letter with their marker, and so on, back and forth until the word is complete. They are allowed to help each other while they're writing. Then they replace the caps on the markers and announce loudly that they're done. The group that finishes the word first and without mistakes is the winner.

## Variations

* Groups of three kids can be fun as well. You'll need another color of marker and the words will have to be long enough so that everyone gets to have an adequate amount of practice.

* I often play a variation of this game with full sentences. In this case I have the students alternate writing every word or punctuation.

* During the last few rounds I like to pair students with ... *themselves*! When this happens they'll need to figure out how to write using two markers at once while alternating the colors. It's never not funny to watch.

## Considerations

* Some kids can be extremely rough on markers. Maybe don't let them use your favorite ones.

* You might not have enough erasers so that every group has their own, so they need to share. If this happens this you can draw a semicircles at the bottom of the board between groups where the shared erasers can stay when they're not being used. Otherwise students won't be unable to find one when it's needed.

* You'll need a way to fairly pick groups of students and perhaps also to keep points, if that's something you like to do with your students. I use small pieces of paper with my students' names on them. Marking points on them is easy and I can choose to shuffle them between rounds to make random groups or, if there's a wide variance in ability, assign students to groups that are well-balanced.
