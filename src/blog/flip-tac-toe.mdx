Look, I'm not going to pretend that there's some educational content to
this game. There just isn't any. Look at the tags for this post. Do you see "ESL" there, like in the posts for my other games? Of course not. I couldn't bring myself to use that tag here. It is really fun though and your students will love it!

I saw a game like this a long, long time ago on a kind of made-for-kids variety game show in Taiwan. I tried looking for it, but haven't had any luck. If you can find it, do let me know.
