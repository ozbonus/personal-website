# Hello Chris

My personal website.

## Color palette

To keep things simple, this site uses colors built into Tailwind. The three primary colors of the light mode are:

![alt](/readme_images/amber-400.svg) yellow-400

![alt](/readme_images/cyan-600.svg) cyan-600

![red-700](/readme_images/red-700.svg) red-700

Various shades of these colors are used throughout the site. The light mode tends warmer and the dark mode tends cooler. Illustrations use mildly desaturated versions of these colors.
